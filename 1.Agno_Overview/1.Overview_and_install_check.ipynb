    "\n",
    "Agno is a fast multi-agent framework, runtime and control plane.\\\n",
    "Use it to build multi-agent systems with **memory, knowledge, human in the loop and MCP**.\n",
    "You can orchestrate agents as multi-agent teams or step-based agentic workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use it?\n",
    "It can build production ready agent system quickly, with full runtime and control plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "- A minimal, high-performance framework for Agents, Teams and Workflow.\n",
    "- A production runtime FastAPI app called AgentOS.\n",
    "- A Control Plane UI (AgentOS UI or web) that connects directly to your runtime app (AgentOS) for testing, monitoring and management.\n",
    "- Private-by-design: Agent runs in your cloud, UI connects to it directly, no external data retention.\n",
